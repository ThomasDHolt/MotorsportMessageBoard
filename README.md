## What requirements did I achieve
- I created a dynamic form which works as expected and submits data when the submit button is pressed.
- I implemented media queries so that the page retains it's form and is readable on a mobile phone.
- I implemented an API GET route so that messages can be retrieved from the SQL server.
- I implemented an API POST route so that new messages can be sent to the SQL server.
- I included a seed file which contains the boilerplate SQL statements for getting the database ready.
- The form contains some basic form validation, for instance the rating field is limited (0 < n < 5), and the date for each message is retrieved by the computer so validating wasn't necessary for that specific value.
- I implemented an API DELETE route so that messages can be deleted by clicking on a delete button.
- I implemented an API PUT route which adds likes to a message depending on which you click on.

## Were there any requirements or goals that I was unable to achieve
- The styling for the assignment has been relatively simple and not pretty when compared to previous weeks, therefore the UX experience is fairly barebones and only simple animations are shown when you hover over a button.

## What was it that I found difficult about these tasks
- I spent a majority of my time working on the back-end of the web page, so it wasn't a case of me finding the task difficult, it's more I just didn't have enough time.
